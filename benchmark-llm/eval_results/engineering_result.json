The area of the room is 4m * 3m = 12 m\u00b2.  The total lumens needed are 50 lux * 12 m\u00b2 = 600 lumens.  Each lamp provides 300 lumens, so the number of lamps needed is 600 lumens / 300 lumens/lamp = 2 lamps. The answer is (C).\n"}, {"question_id": 11286, "question": "Stack is also known as", "options": ["FIFO memory", "Flash memory", "LIFO memory", "LILO memory"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "cot_content": "", "category": "engineering", "src": "ori_mmlu-electrical_engineering", "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "The answer is (C)\n"}, {"question_id": 11287, "question": "The errors mainly caused by human mistakes are", "options": ["gross error.", "instrumental error.", "systematic error."], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "cot_content": "", "category": "engineering", "src": "ori_mmlu-electrical_engineering", "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "The answer is (A)\n"}]
