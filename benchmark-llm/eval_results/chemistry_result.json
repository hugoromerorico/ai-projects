A high melting point suggests strong intermolecular forces.  Poor conductivity of electricity rules out ionic and metallic bonding.  Insolubility in water rules out ionic bonding and many polar substances. This leaves covalent network bonding as the most likely option.  Covalent network solids have strong covalent bonds throughout the entire structure, leading to high melting points and poor conductivity. The answer is (C).\nThe answer is (C)\n"}, {"question_id": 3527, "question": "Which of the following has an octet of electrons around the central atom?", "options": ["BF3", "BeF2", "PF5", "NH4+", "SF6"], "answer": "D", "answer_index": 3, "cot_content": "", "category": "chemistry", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_chemistry", "pred": "D", "model_outputs": "The answer is (D)\n"}, {"question_id": 3528, "question": "How many milliliters of 0.250 M KOH does it take to neutralize completely 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H3PO4?", "options": ["75.0 mL", "90.0 mL", "60.0 mL", "120 mL", "30.0 mL", "180 mL", "270 mL", "100 mL", "27 mL", "150 mL"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "cot_content": "", "category": "chemistry", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_chemistry", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let's think step by step.  The balanced equation for the neutralization reaction is:\n\n3KOH(aq) + H3PO4(aq) \u2192 K3PO4(aq) + 3H2O(l)\n\nFirst, calculate the moles of H3PO4:\n\nmoles H3PO4 = (0.150 mol/L) * (0.0500 L) = 0.00750 mol\n\nFrom the stoichiometry of the balanced equation, 3 moles of KOH react with 1 mole of H3PO4.  Therefore, the moles of KOH needed are:\n\nmoles KOH = 3 * moles H3PO4 = 3 * 0.00750 mol = 0.0225 mol\n\nNow, calculate the volume of 0.250 M KOH needed:\n\nVolume KOH = moles KOH / Molarity KOH = 0.0225 mol / (0.250 mol/L) = 0.0900 L = 90.0 mL\n\nThe answer is (B).\n"}]
