A man approached the woman from behind and grabbed the purse off the seat. He then pushed the woman out of the way and ran out of the subway car while carrying the purse. The man was apprehended on the subway platform while in possession of the purse. In a jurisdiction that follows the common law with respect to criminal offenses, of what crime can the man properly be convicted?", "options": ["Fraud, because he took the purse without the woman's consent.", "Larceny, because he took the purse without the woman's permission.", "Burglary, because he entered the subway car with the intention of committing a theft.", "Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.", "Robbery, because he used force to take possession of the purse.", "Robbery, because he used force to remove the woman from the purse's vicinity.", "Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse.", "Assault, because he pushed the woman out of the way.", "Larceny, because he made no threat to use force.", "Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence."], "answer": "D", "answer_index": 3, "cot_content": "", "category": "law", "src": "ori_mmlu-professional_law", "pred": "E", "model_outputs": "The man used force to take the purse and escape.  This is the definition of robbery.  The fact that the force was used after he initially took the purse doesn't negate the robbery charge.

The grand jury issued a subpoena requiring the corporation to produce all emails and internal documents regarding the corporation's knowledge of the risks of an oil spill.

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?", "options": ["It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.", "It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.", "It goes against the spirit of the Twenty-fourth Amendment by effectively imposing a \"literacy tax.\"", "It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.", "It violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating write-in candidates differently.", "It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.", "It unreasonably limits the means by which a candidate can campaign, infringing on democratic practices.", "It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.", "It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.", "It interferes with the right to vote as guaranteed by the Nineteenth Amendment."], "answer": "F", "answer_index": 5, "cot_content": "", "category": "law", "src": "ori_mmlu-professional_law", "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "The strongest argument is that the law disproportionately affects German-speaking voters who may have difficulty writing in the candidate's name in English, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
