Ethical guidelines for psychologists emphasize avoiding bias based on personal beliefs. While a therapist's personal feelings are important, they shouldn't be the sole reason to refuse treatment.  The best course of action is to refer Hermann to another therapist if the therapist's personal feelings are significantly impacting their ability to provide unbiased care.  Option D directly addresses this, suggesting a referral based on shared political views, which is not ideal, but it's the closest option to ethical practice in this scenario. Option I is also acceptable, as it provides a referral without explicitly stating the reason. However, Option D is more direct and addresses the core issue.\n\nThe answer is (D).\n"}, {"question_id": 1988, "question": "During the second stage of Kohlberg\u2019s preconventional level of moral development, children obey rules because:", "options": ["they are taught that rules are unbreakable.", "they enjoy following the rules.", "they are rewarded for following rules.", "they feel they have a personal duty to uphold rules and laws.", "doing so helps them satisfy their personal needs.", "they understand the concept of fairness and justice.", "doing so helps them avoid punishment.", "\"\"\"everyone else is doing it.\"\"\"", "they believe in the inherent goodness of rules.", "they fear societal disapproval."], "answer": "E", "answer_index": 4, "cot_content": "", "category": "psychology", "src": "ori_mmlu-professional_psychology", "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "Let's think step by step.
