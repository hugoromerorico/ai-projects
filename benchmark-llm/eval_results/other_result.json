The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, passed by the US Congress in 1964, authorized President Lyndon B. Johnson to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against US forces and to prevent further aggression in Southeast Asia.

The goal is to explore opinions, attitudes, and experiences on a particular topic.  Option C accurately reflects this: the qualitative data gathered can inform the development of more structured quantitative tools like surveys.  The other options are incorrect because focus groups are not designed for random sampling (A), generalizing to larger populations (B), or using formal research tools (D).  They are also not limited to market research (F), require participants with similar backgrounds (G), are the most efficient way to gather quantitative data (H), involve passive observation by the facilitator (I), or require a minimum of 20 participants (J).
