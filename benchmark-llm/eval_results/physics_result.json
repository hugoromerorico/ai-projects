This precise orbital relationship causes significant tidal forces, affecting the moons' shapes and internal structures.  The most significant effect is the intense volcanic activity on Io, driven by tidal heating.  While it doesn't directly cause a straight line alignment, prevent collisions, or create a gap, the resonance is crucial to the system's dynamics. The answer is (B).\n\nThe answer is (B)\n"}, {"question_id": 9045, "question": "We were first able to accurately measure the diameter of Pluto from:", "options": ["Lunar-based observations made during NASA's Apollo missions", "The Voyager 2 spacecraft flyby in the 1980s", "Observations made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory", "brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon", "The Mars Rover's telescope observations of Pluto", "radar observations made by the Arecibo telescope", "Observations made by the Spitzer Space Telescope", "Hubble Space Telescope images that resolved Pluto's disk", "a New Horizons flyby in the 1990s", "Images captured by the Kepler Space Telescope"], "answer": "D", "answer_index": 3, "cot_content": "", "category": "physics", "src": "ori_mmlu-astronomy", "pred": "D", "model_outputs": "Let's think step by step.
